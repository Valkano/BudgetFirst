TODO:

Later optimisations
-------------------
* Test how having thousands, or even millions, of events affects aggregate rehydration speed. Especially on mobile devices
	We could keep an identity map. Must be able to reset after sync.

* Read model repository: check how fast rebuild of model after sync is, especially on mobile devices
	might have to snapshot? (but have to know if snapshot can be used, i.e. no new events were added in meantime. vector clocks?)
