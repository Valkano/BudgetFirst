# Budget First

Budget First is an open source budget application based on the envelope budgeting or zero-sum budget approach, in which income is partitioned in various categories and spending only occurs from these categories. We plan to support Windows, OSX, Linux, iOS and Android.

Budget First is currently in development. 
We are a small team and are working in our spare time on this project, so please be patient :)
